# Following My Progress Through Reading *"Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship"* by Robert C. Martin

### Chapter 1: Clean Code
As someone new to learning code (and someone who wants to learn to do it well), this book was a great gift to receive so early in my process. The first chapter appears to be a great way to set my mentality up for success to become a good programmer.

Having never worked with code "on the job" it was helpful to know a bit more about what to look for and how very important clean code really is. It makes sense that the more "hands in the pot," the messier code may become, especially with a large project that's ongoing. But, I've come to see, coding does not need to be this way.

If code is kept clean and precise with good notes there should be no reason for code to become muddled over time. The best way I can tell to avoid this, whether designing new code or working on old, is to care deeply about the code and keeping it trim and functioning at its best at all times.

Sure, at times there will be tight deadlines with managers and customers chomping at the bit for a new release, but it seems like good programmers also need to learn to stand their ground to keep their code as the top priority. That's not just to keep their own timing from being rushed, but moreover to keep the integrity of the software itself. If it starts off sloppy and rushed, it will be harder and harder each time one needs to update or make a change.

I especially liked the section "What Is Clean Code?" where the author shared the definition of clean code from well-known programmers:

- **Bjarne Stroutstrup:** "Clean code does one thing well." I like this simplicity. He also states that clean code is "elegant" which sounds oddly fitting. If the code is well-written it should be hard for bugs to hide, almost disruptive.
- **Grady Booch:** "...reads like well-written prose." Grady's explanation made me realize that code can actually be *read*! The code is telling a story of the solution to the problem.
- **"Big" Dave Thomas:** Dave indicates that clean code can also be easily changed by *others*. It should be straightforward with one way of doing things that can be replicated.
- **Michael Feathers:** This passage was what really resonated with me on that *caring* perspective I mentioned earlier. Take the time to keep it simple, pay attention to details so others can nurture it, too!
- **Ron Jeffries:** Ron focuses a lot on keeping things minimal, removing duplicates, and making sure that the code runs all of the tests. It is expressive, yet it also performs well.
- **Ward Cunningham:** Ward says it's clean code when you run and call it and get basically what you'd expect. It sounds obvious, but with so much detail can be hard to achieve. He also says it's "beautiful code when the code also makes it look like the language was made for the problem."

The author later goes on to remind the reader that coding is akin to being an author yourself. Others will be reading your code and it's our responsibility to communicate clearly.

Overall, though, my favorite takeaway was the idea of the Boy Scout Rule: "leave the campground cleaner than you found it" being applied to code. I love this sentiment already and had not considered this could be applied to a code project where many others can get in and mess around with code. I will definitely keep this in mind as I move forward!
