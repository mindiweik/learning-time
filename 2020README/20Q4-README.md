After a couple of nights over the past 2 weeks going over episode 11 in the Website Development With Python & Flask [Skillshare](https://skl.sh/2HonVZs) course I continued to encounter issues getting it to work. Tonight I discovered a tab/space issue within one of the Python files and I was able to get the web app working again. I was able to complete episode 12 as well which covered html templates.
