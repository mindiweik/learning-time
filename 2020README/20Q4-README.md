# learning-time Q4 2020
Personal projects documenting things I am practicing from what I've recently learned and sharing my research findings in my quest to learn something new about programming each and every day! I mainly use a Macbook Pro and a Raspberry Pi 4 running Raspian.

Today I was able to finish up the basic Todo List project from the Website Development With Python & Flask [Skillshare](https://skl.sh/2HonVZs) course. I especially liked learning about always on and - in this case - how to use Uptime Robot which will ping the Repl.it project to keep it active so I can view and share with others. I will upload the current version to GitHub.

In the near future I'd like to actually edit the Home page, add in a few other features, and ask friends and family to test it out and give feedback. When I make updates I will upload the newest version.

Reviewing and completing episode 17 of the the Website Development With Python & Flask [Skillshare](https://skl.sh/2HonVZs) course leaves me with a functioning register and login setup for the todo list app! There was a lot of troubleshooting to ensure things were still working properly. I also imported a few things into the wrong files so I found that and switched those around.

I also reviewed my HTML, CSS and JavaScript notes from the last few months and intend to do so over the next couple of weeks.

Initially I reviewed the most recent episode I covered (episode 16) from the Website Development With Python & Flask [Skillshare](https://skl.sh/2HonVZs) course. Upon review, I moved on to continue the login and registration portions. I watched - and worked through - the first half of episode 17 which continued to build out the python files for login and registration.

Continuing with the Website Development With Python & Flask [Skillshare](https://skl.sh/2HonVZs) course, episode 15 covered how to save and commit to the database. I then completed episode 16 which went over the login and registration HTML pages and the routes for the flask portion of the  web app. 

I am actually excited about episode 16 and moving onto episode 17 as these are both covering how to login and this was where I began to feel overwhelmed in the [CS50 Intro to Computer Science](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/course/) final project for the Web Developmennt track.

This evening I worked through episodes 13 and 14 from the Website Development With Python & Flask [Skillshare](https://skl.sh/2HonVZs) course. Episode 13 covered how to add in a navigation bar. Then episode 14 covered how to write script to edit the items in the lists. This does not currently update the database itself, but we are going to cover that in the next lesson.

### October 14, 2020
After a couple of nights over the past 2 weeks going over episode 11 in the Website Development With Python & Flask [Skillshare](https://skl.sh/2HonVZs) course I continued to encounter issues getting it to work. Tonight I discovered a tab/space issue within one of the Python files and I was able to get the web app working again. I was able to complete episode 12 as well which covered html templates.
