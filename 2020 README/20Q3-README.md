# learning-time Q2 2020
Personal projects documenting things I am practicing from what I've recently learned and sharing my research findings in my quest to learn something new about programming each and every day! I mainly use a Macbook Pro and a Raspberry Pi 4 running Raspian.


### August 25, 2020
I watched the last major video which covered the overall aspects of the CS50 Finance project for the [CS50 Intro to Computer Science](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/course/) Web Track. The "capstone" project if you will for the end of the course. I spent some time also beginning the setup steps to get started.

It looks like most of this project will be building out HTML docs, including a layout.html file for the basic layout of each HTML file and the application.py file with flask implementation of the program's logistics itself. I'm looking forward to diving in!

The next video in the [CS50 Intro to Computer Science](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/course/) Web Track covered Databases, adding together all of the knowledge built-up thus far to create a sample registration web app. This covered:
- HTML pages, including a layout.html page for the basic HTML template
- Python and Flask in am application.py file
- SQL using a sqlite database to store the registrant information
- Continued expansion of knowledge upon all of the above uses

### August 18-19, 2020
After starting a new job I was ready to get back into programming. I am particularly excited to finish my final project for the [CS50 Intro to Computer Science](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/course/).

Before diving in, there are a few videos showing more tools to be used to implement the final Finance project. Over these two days I worked through the Flask video. I learned how to use a layout.html document to make other html documents much shorter and easier to implement and make changes across all documents. I also learned how to build out the flask app using application.py and that you can use html, JavaScript, and python together to make a really interactive experience, even on a fairly simplistic level.

I spent time adding in some of the filler details I previously missed in the HTML document for the [CS50 Intro to Computer Science](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/course/) Homepage project.

I also worked to fix up the CSS document to work on the more overall visuals like colors, background, and such. Prior work on the CSS document contained mainly just little details like the font and arrangement/layout elements.

Here are some items I was having trouble with, but managed to figure out:
- Two of my pages talking about my dogs individually had weird, extra spacing in the paragraphs. After looking through my code I realized my justify class added an additional padding around each of the entire paragraphs rather than just the sides which was what I initially intended so I incorporated padding-left and padding-right in the class to correct the error. 
- Once I edited the visuals to include some blue standard links were then difficult to see. For a previous project I remembered finding some info on editing the link options and used the multiple options for hover, visited, etc. from [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_link.asp).

I was able to get this simple project to a place where it is acceptable for it being a simple project. I may come back to make it "prettier" but for now it is functional and minimalistic. The project can be found in the html-projects folder and the html and css documents as well as the photos I used are all within the homepage-cs50 folder.

### July 9, 2020
Another day spent inputting information as well as images within the 4 html documents for the [CS50 Intro to Computer Science](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/course/) Homepage project. I spent some time working on some of the basic CSS elements I know I wanted to incorporate as well: 
- centered body
- justified paragraphs in Rosie and Rigby's information pages
- images to look a certain way and begin to be responsive
- the "favorite things" table to have good spacing
- consistent, albeit basic, font-family

### July 8, 2020
After a short break I started in on the [CS50 Intro to Computer Science](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/course/) Homepage project by starting with setting up all 4 of the required html documents. I then added in most of the written information I planned to include and will work on finishing adding in the html pieces and then work on the styling this week.

### July 3, 2020
Today I completed the "JavaScript" video for the web track section of [CS50 Intro to Computer Science](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/course/) which was - again - a great refresher before moving onto the projects for the final section.

I also watched the "Homepage" video which gave the parameters for the first basic web track project to create a simple web page. Must include:
- HTML - at least 4 pages that are navigable to each other
- CSS - named "styles.css" linked in the html file, must use at least 5 CSS selectors of choice; must use at least 1 Bootstrap element
- JS - to be used at our discretion, but must be included to some degree

I also spent some time brainstorming an idea for this simple site and then sketching out the frame and components I plan to use to hit all of the requirements. Over the weekend I will begin building the site.

### July 1, 2020
I moved on to the next video in the web track section of [CS50 Intro to Computer Science](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/course/). This video was called "HTML" and was also mainly a review of HTML basics. It is, however, helpful to have this refresher before diving into the final project(s).

I also watched the "CSS" video which was an additional refresher/review for me.
