# learning-time Q2 2020
Personal projects documenting things I am practicing from what I've recently learned and sharing my research findings in my quest to learn something new about programming each and every day! I mainly use a Macbook Pro and a Raspberry Pi 4 running Raspian.

I moved on to the next video in the web track section of [CS50 Intro to Computer Science](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/course/). This video was called "HTML" and was also mainly a review of HTML basics. It is, however, helpful to have this refresher before diving into the final project(s).

I also watched the "CSS" video which was an additional refresher/review for me.
