# learning-time Q2 2020
Personal projects documenting things I am practicing from what I've recently learned and sharing my research findings in my quest to learn something new about programming each and every day! I mainly use a Macbook Pro and a Raspberry Pi 4 running Raspian.

Another day spent inputting information as well as images within the 4 html documents for the [CS50 Intro to Computer Science](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/course/) Homepage project. I spent some time working on some of the basic CSS elements I know I wanted to incorporate as well: 
- centered body
- justified paragraphs in Rosie and Rigby's information pages
- images to look a certain way and begin to be responsive
- the "favorite things" table to have good spacing
- consistent, albeit basic, font-family

After a short break I started in on the [CS50 Intro to Computer Science](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/course/) Homepage project by starting with setting up all 4 of the required html documents. I then added in most of the written information I planned to include and will work on finishing adding in the html pieces and then work on the styling this week.

Today I completed the "JavaScript" video for the web track section of [CS50 Intro to Computer Science](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/course/) which was - again - a great refresher before moving onto the projects for the final section.

I also watched the "Homepage" video which gave the parameters for the first basic web track project to create a simple web page. Must include:
- HTML - at least 4 pages that are navigable to each other
- CSS - named "styles.css" linked in the html file, must use at least 5 CSS selectors of choice; must use at least 1 Bootstrap element
- JS - to be used at our discretion, but must be included to some degree

I also spent some time brainstorming an idea for this simple site and then sketching out the frame and components I plan to use to hit all of the requirements. Over the weekend I will begin building the site.

I moved on to the next video in the web track section of [CS50 Intro to Computer Science](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/course/). This video was called "HTML" and was also mainly a review of HTML basics. It is, however, helpful to have this refresher before diving into the final project(s).

I also watched the "CSS" video which was an additional refresher/review for me.
