        <p class="justify">Rosie was adopted by her family after she was found roaming the rural hills of Missouri. She was rescued
        by a Humane Society in Monroe County, Illinois from a kill shelter. It took her a little while to get used to her family, but
        in the end she feels right at home chasing squirrels in her backyard and chewing on bones when she is stuck inside. Her family
        refers to her as a "runner" because the beagle side in her takes over when she sees any sort of small prey. If her poeple aren't
        careful she will take off running after a rabbit!</p>

        <p class="justify">Although she feels comfortable in her home now, Rosie has moved 4 times with her family over the course of the
        6 years she has been with them. Rosie is extremely intelligent and knew what was happening each time. She got a little stressed each
        time, though she is a very adaptive creature and slipped into a new routine easily. She has lived at her home now for the last 2 years
        and truly enjoys having the room to run around, neighbor dogs to bark along with when strangers approach, and plenty of wildlife to
        run after and sun to bask in.</p>
