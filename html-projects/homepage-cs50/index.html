        <p>Rosie and Rigby are two fun-loving pups. Although they are very different, they both love being a part of their family.</p>
        <p>Rosie is the oldest by 6 years. She prefers meeting new people to dogs, but does tolerate her younger "brother" on a daily
        basis.</p>
        <p>Rigby is a little Momma's Boy who leaps at the chance to play with other doggos any chance he gets.</p>
