        <p class="justify">Rigby was born in a home in Pueblo, Colorado where he was raised for the
        first 9 weeks of his life with both of his parents and his siblings. His new family came to
        see him and his final remaining brother. Rigby (originally named "Andrew") stole the heart of
        his new parents and his sister was tolerant enough that it was determined he would fit the
        best with his new family.</p>

        <p class="justify">Rigby is a rambunctious little guy. He loves to play fetch and to run around
        playing chase with other dogs, particularly his sister. He is more wary of people, but he
        absolutely adores other dogs. His favorite days are when he gets to go to the dog park or the
        doggie day care he sometimes frequents. No matter what, he just wants to run around and be his
        normal happy self!</p>
