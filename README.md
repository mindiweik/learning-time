# learning-time
Personal projects practicing things I've recently learned, attempting new things, and sharing my research findings in my quest to learn something new each and every day! I mainly use a Macbook Pro and a Raspberry Pi 4 running Raspian.

*I am a total "newb" who is just trying to learn about new things that interest me! Please excuse any incorrect use of terms or language that may arise over time while I learn. I intend to cite and link whenever possible.*


### January 30, 2020
Moving forward with the [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) **Responsive Web Design Certificate**, I completed parts 20-30 out of 52.

### January 29, 2020
I continued working on the [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) **Responsive Web Design Certificate**. I am still in the "Applied Visual Design" section completing 13-19 out of 52.

### January 28, 2020
After working on some of the [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) trainings for another reason, I was recently reviewing the other available information and trainings they have and noticed there were many more structured HTML, CSS and JavaScript certifications. Therefore, I have decided to continue working these as I have already made some significant progress already. Picking up where I left off puts me in the middle of the **Responsive Web Design Certificate** starting at the "Applied Visual Design" section and making it through parts 1-12 out of 52.

### January 24-26, 2020
These last few days I was reviewing and reorganizing/rewriting all of my notes on HTML, CSS and JavaScript that I have accumulated thus far.

### January 23, 2020
Today I finished up the "Turtle Race!" project, including the final 2-3 challenges to try to figure out the code on your own. I was able to figure all of them out with some fiddling on my own except for 1: the "Dashed Lines" challenge. I knew it liekly needed to be a nested for loop, but wasn't entirely sure on the formatting and numbers so I did find an online resource to help me out with this. The final version of tyhe project should be available to view in my python-projects folder.

*Over the last few days I have also continued to review my CSS and JavaScript coding notes.*

### January 22, 2020
Starting to learn more about the various programming languages available I am working on a vary basic project. One of the recommended introductory projects for Python was the "Turtle Race!" which I felt would be helpful to learn while also being lighthearted. Today I got to the "Racing Turtles" section of the tutorial.

### January 21, 2020
Today I completed the last few exercises, Lesson 13 - 15, from "Learn Python the Hard Way". At the end they have some reference material to continue working with Bash and/or the terminal. I played around with some of the commands to familiarize myself, including the info command, the exit command, removing a file and removing a directory, and streaming a file as well as paging up/down within said file.

### January 15-16, 2020
I spent these two days reviewing my noes on JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

### January 14, 2020
My time today was spent reviewing some of my JavaScript notes and moving forward with the lessons from "Learn Python the Hard Way" getting through Exercises 9 - 12. In addition to practicing the other exercises as I continue through, I also spent time learning about making empty files with touch (or new-item for Windows), copying a file with cp, moving files around with mv, and viewing files with the less command.

### January 13, 2020
The focus today was reading more in *Clean Code*. I read chapter 2 which explored much about naming recommendations and suggestions for cleaner code and overall best practices which appears to apply to most every computer language.

### January 12, 2020
Continuing from the lesson where I left off I completed lessons 5 - 8 from Learn Pythin the Hard Way. The most memorable lesson today was the information for additional ways to navigate through the directories using (cd ..) to go back 1 directory, (cd ../../..) to jump back 3+ directories, and the (pushd) and (popd) commands to save and jump to/through a list of saved directories.

### January 10, 2020
To learn more about the terminal and the basics of Python, the site below was recommended. I spent time with lessons 1 - 4 in the free time I had today. Most memorable takeawy is that using the print working directoy (pwd) command will help you get your bearings and then the (cd ~) command will take you back to the home directory.

> [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/appendix-a-cli/introduction.html) - Starting with the advice to "SHUT UP AND TYPE ALL OF THIS IN." I dove into the first 4 lessons.

### January 9, 2020
I reworked and finalized my *Clean Code* Markdown file and moved it into a folder I created locally to see how the file system worked within GitHub. I read up on creating folders over the last few days and found out that an empty folder will not be stored/show up on GitHub. Additionally, I started chapter 2 of *Clean Code*.

### January 8, 2020
I wrote up a reflection on chapter 1 of *Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship* by Robert C. Martin in a new Markdown file.

### January 7, 2020
I created a new repository in GitHub using my new Raspberry Pi 4 (built last week). I used my terminal to download a Visual Studio Code remake made to support Raspian on a Linux platform. I spent time writing in my main README file which I will use as a sort of diary entry to briefly describe my daily activities.

> Followed the links [found here](https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-visual-studio-code/) - A big thank you to [@headmelted](https://github.com/headmelted) for building [a version of VSC](https://code.headmelted.com/) for alternative users!

Later I worked to set up a new folder (which I haven't done yet) for following the book I'm reading, *Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship* by Robert C. Martin. I wasn't entirely successful, but will continue this research to do it correctly.
