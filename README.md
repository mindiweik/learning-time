# learning-time
Personal projects practicing things I've recently learned, attempting new things, and sharing my research findings in my quest to learn something new each and every day!

*I am a total "newb" who is just trying to learn about new things that interest me! Please excuse any incorrect use of terms or language that may arise over time while I learn. I intend to cite and link whenever possible.*

The focus today was reading more in *Clean Code*. I read chapter 2 which explored much about naming recommendations and suggestions for cleaner code and overall best practices which appears to apply to most every computer language.

Continuing from the lesson where I left off I completed lessons 5 - 8 from Learn Pythin the Hard Way. The most memorable lesson today was the information for additional ways to navigate through the directories using (cd ..) to go back 1 directory, (cd ../../..) to jump back 3+ directories, and the (pushd) and (popd) commands to save and jump to/through a list of saved directories.

To learn more about the terminal and the basics of Python, the site below was recommended. I spent time with lessons 1 - 4 in the free time I had today. Most memorable takeawy is that using the print working directoy (pwd) command will help you get your bearings and then the (cd ~) command will take you back to the home directory.

> [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/appendix-a-cli/introduction.html) - Starting with the advice to "SHUT UP AND TYPE ALL OF THIS IN." I dove into the first 4 lessons.

### January 9, 2020
I reworked and finalized my *Clean Code* Markdown file and moved it into a folder I created locally to see how the file system worked within GitHub. I read up on creating folders over the last few days and found out that an empty folder will not be stored/show up on GitHub. Additionally, I started chapter 2 of *Clean Code*.

### January 8, 2020
I wrote up a reflection on chapter 1 of *Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship* by Robert C. Martin in a new Markdown file.

### January 7, 2020
I created a new repository in GitHub using my new Raspberry Pi 4 (built last week). I used my terminal to download a Visual Studio Code remake made to support Raspian on a Linux platform. I spent time writing in my main README file which I will use as a sort of diary entry to briefly describe my daily activities.

> Followed the links [found here](https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-visual-studio-code/) - A big thank you to [@headmelted](https://github.com/headmelted) for building [a version of VSC](https://code.headmelted.com/) for alternative users!

Later I worked to set up a new folder (which I haven't done yet) for following the book I'm reading, *Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship* by Robert C. Martin. I wasn't entirely successful, but will continue this research to do it correctly.
