# learning-time
Personal projects practicing things I've recently learned, attempting new things, and sharing my research findings in my quest to learn something new each and every day!

*I am a total "newb" who is just trying to learn about new things that interest me! Please excuse any incorrect use of terms or language that may arise over time while I learn. I intend to cite and link whenever possible.*

I created a new repository in GitHub using my new Raspberry Pi 4 (built last week). I used my terminal to download a Visual Studio Code remake made to support Raspian on a Linux platform. I spent time writing in my main README file which I will use as a sort of diary entry to briefly describe my daily activities.

> Followed the links [found here](https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-visual-studio-code/) - A big thank you to [@headmelted](https://github.com/headmelted) for building [a version of VSC](https://code.headmelted.com/) for alternative users!

Later I worked to set up a new folder (which I haven't done yet) for following the book I'm reading, *Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship* by Robert C. Martin.
