# learning-time
Personal projects documenting things I am practicing from what I've recently learned and sharing my research findings in my quest to learn something new about programming each and every day! I mainly use a Macbook Pro and a Raspberry Pi 4 running Raspian.

*I am a total "newb" who is just trying to learn about new things that interest me! Please excuse any incorrect use of terms or language that may arise over time while I learn. I intend to cite and link whenever possible.*


### March 27, 2020
The first C Problem Set I approached was "Mario" which was recreating the pyramids from a Mario screen shot. This one was a challenge and I had a hard time figuring out how to start with it. Eventually I wrote out my pseudocode on my own notes (added into the code later and ran into some issues with the CS50 "Sandbox" not being synced up with the code I was writing which was frustrating at first, but once I figured it out made perfect sense. 

Today I learned that I should start small and build up from there. I initially jumped into the harder version because I wanted to try the "challenge". But it made the task much more daunting and I went back to the "less" version and after building that the "more" version was much easier to produce. 

I also learned about how to use multiple-nested for loops and I used a do while loop to make sure the prompt for user information ran at least once and kept running until it received an acceptable answer between 1-8.

### March 26, 2020
I completed the "Conditional Statements", "Loops" and "Command Line" Shorts videos today from the Week 1 [CS50 Intro to Computer Science](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/course/) C lecture. Tomorrow I will work on the Problem Set given as homework for the C lesson.

Although I have already learned a lot about these same concepts in my other learning sessions, I wanted to point out that I thought it would be helpful to learn about how they work in C because:
1. I wanted to know if they act the same as the JS operators and conditionals and loops, etc.
2. If C is one of the more old languages it would make sense that other languages likely derived *FROM* C, so knowing more about how C works could lend me to better understand 

### March 25, 2020
I completed the "Operators" Shorts video today from the Week 1 [CS50 Intro to Computer Science](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/course/) C lecture.

### March 23-24, 2020
I finished the Week 1 [CS50 Intro to Computer Science](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/course/) C lecture and the first "Shorts" video, or followup lecture, which reviews the main data types in C and how to use them.

### March 19, 2020
With all of the issues with COVID-19 I've been oddly enough quite busy and only had time to move forward with another section of the same Week 1 [CS50 Intro to Computer Science](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/course/) lecture covering the language C. It's also a new language to me so I'm trying to listen thoroughly and take many notes for myself!

### March 17, 2020
I spent a few hours reviewing all of my notes for HTML, CSS and JavaScript to keep them fresh of mind.

### March 16, 2020
Now that I've submitted the assignment from Week 0 I wanted to jump into the Week 1 course from [CS50's Intro to Computer Science](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/course/). I began the first lecture and made it partway through.

### March 14, 2020
Today I spent time correcting an error I was having with my sound loop during the part where my triceratops shares the dream story. After that I decided to add in 2 additional conditions with loops that made both dinosaurs animate while they moved to simulate walking and flying. I spent a few tries on my own and did some [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) research and eventually stumbled upon the answer to make them move while also animating. 

> To view the project live, find it here: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/375396726 | I have uploaded an updated version of my scratch project with this GitHub push, and this second version is the one I am submitting to the CS50 course for review.

### March 12, 2020
Hours of work went into researching and building my "Dino Dream-lib" project in [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/). I have added a scratch folder to keep the project in and intend to work more on it over the next few days to finalize some details, add in some others, and correct a few minor bugs I'm having.

### March 11, 2020
Using [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) online I started to build my project. I selected 2 sprites that will have a "conversation" about a dream. I sought sprites that had multiple costumes with poses that fit what I was hoping to achieve and found two fun dinosaurs.

I then built out the beginning of the conversation with 2-second wait periods between their speech bubbles and added in the entry points, or questions the dino will ask the user, and made variables to collect the data the user will input to add into the madlib. 

Tomorrow I will finish the conversation piece by building out the story and completing the conversation between the dinos. Ideally I would like to work on the costume changes as well and hope to figure those out. I also need to figure out how and where to add in a loop and a condition to the code as those are requirements in this project, but I want to get it mainly working first so that may happen over the next few days.

### March 10, 2020
After much time spent brainstorming ideas yesterday, I thought over my top few ideas to determine which one is basic enough to complete in a short time frame, complex enough that it will be a challenge and teach me something, and - most importantly - would be engaging for a user. I've landed on a "DREAM-lib" using mad lib style to tell a sprite about a funny/weird dream you had. 

I saw quite a few other examples of mad lib-style projects, but I would like to still try to make mine unique enough that it doesn't fall into the others. But, as I mentioned, I did want to complete this fairly quickly because there's so much yet to learn!

So today I spent my time:
- Reviewing my project ideas
- Determining which idea fits the project best
- Planning out the basics of the project
- Making sure I plan for all of the requirements of the project

Tomorrow I will begin building the code!

### March 9, 2020
I completed the lecture for Week 0 from the [CS50's Intro to Computer Science](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/course/) course. The biggest takeaway I feel I got from this first lecture was actually understanding more about how binary works and that across the board all languages tend to follow a similar pattern with functions, conditions, loops, booleans, etc. to get the desired effect from the code. My next step here is to build a project in Scratch an interactive project to submit.

Today I will start by brainstorming, selecting and planning the project of my choosing. Over the next 2-3 days I intend to design and finish my Scratch project and submit to the course as well as on my "learning-time" repo.

### March 5, 2020
A firm believer in continuity, I completed the second half of the "Responsive Web Design Principles" section of the [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) **Responsive Web Design Certificate** series. Although this was a shorter series, I felt it was very informative on how to better integrate media while also making it responsive.

Moving forward with my self-taught education I began the edX [CS50's Introduction to Computer Science](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/course/) course. Today I started with Week 0 and made it through part of the lecture, but also spent time setting up the repository for this course in GitHub to submit projects (which I will also share individually on my "learning-time" repo).

### March 4, 2020
Moving on to the next section I completed the first half (2 out of 4) of the "Responsive Web Design Principles" section of the [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) **Responsive Web Design Certificate** series. I have encountered media queries and responsive images, but it was great to actually learn more about how they operate.

Additionally, I spent some time researching options for me to make more progress on learning programming and all of the general basics one should know to be better prepared. The Harvard edX [CS50's Introduction to Computer Science](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/course/) course comes highly recommended from multiple sources I found. I intend to start this in conjunction with the freeCodeCamp resources.

### March 3, 2020
Today I pushed forward through the "Applied Accessibility" section of the [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) **Responsive Web Design Certificate** series and completed the rest of this series (parts 7-22). 

In addition to learning more about the elements introduced in HTML5, I also learned more about the importance of color design choices aside from the obvious "how does it look" method. By selecting the right contrast ratio, for instance, not only does it make the information more clear for those that see color easily, but it also allows for those with colorblindness to be able to glean information from the text and other important visual information from your web page. I also learned a lot about keyboard focus for keyboard-only users.

My main takeaway from this lesson is that there are many levels of visual and auditory impairment that should be considered when building a site or web page and having good, solid logic when building it is the key. In all honesty I hadn't considered that the way screen readers and other tools operated ahd to do with the overall back-end code. I assumed it had to do with the way the particular devices worked on their own. Though, now that I know more about online accessibility it makes perfect sense that both sides have to work well together so that those with accessibility issues can still access the content in a usable format.

### March 2, 2020
Time learning today was spent on parts 3-6 of 22 in the "Applied Accessibility" section of the [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) **Responsive Web Design Certificate** series. This information is brand new to me and helpful in explaining more about what purposes each of the new HTML5 elements are best suited for.

### February 25, 2020
Today I am moving on to the "Applied Accessibility" section of the [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) **Responsive Web Design Certificate** series. Not only do I recognize that accessibility is important for everyone to be able to get and navigate to all of the information for a company's website, it's also important for people who *rely the aid of their computer* to actually navigate a site and its contents. The world wide web should be accessible for all.

In my learning session today I was able to complete parts 1-2 of 22 in this section. 

### February 21, 2020
After having lots of visitors come through our home and life this month I am back at it working on my coding experience. I picked back up on the [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) **Responsive Web Design Certificate**, completing parts 31-52 out of 52 in the "Applied Visual Design" section. In the last portion it focused a lot on CSS animations which has properties that are actually very similar to some of the video animations I learned in Adobe After Effects and other video editing programs I've toyed with over the years.

### January 30, 2020
Moving forward with the [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) **Responsive Web Design Certificate**, I completed parts 20-30 out of 52 in the "Applied Visual Design" section.

### Monthly Roundup
Over the course of January 2020 I spent time reading "Clean Code", reviewing my notes, learning more about HTML, CSS, and JS, and trying out some Python code for which I applied some of the principles from "Clean Code" by atttempting to create a function that turned the turtles as they were introduced to clean up the code. 

### January 31, 2020 
In an effort to use what I've learned from "Clean Code" thus far, I was challenged to revisit my "Turtle Race!" project and build a function for the twirling part of the code as I initially had to write separate for loops for each individual turtle which is not ideal. I did some basic research on creating python functions as I haven't had much experience with that yet. Creating the function itself was easy enough, but once I added it to the code I had a hard time figuring out how to apply it each consecutive turtle rather than just one. I did come up with one solution that worked, but I was not quite happy with it. This version can be found in turtle-race1.py and consisted of an if else if statement within the function. The major Pros and Cons for turtle-race1.py are as follows:
| PROS | CONS |
| each turtle turns when it is introduced | each turtle is currently named directly |
| the directions for turning is now all in one place rather than under each turtle | if this code were to be used later and someone were to add more turtles, the 5th turtle (eor) would continue turning at each subsequent introduction |

After some more research and many failed attempts and some help from a friend to find the missing piece, I was actually able to complete a more concise code that allows for any number of turtles to be created and an easier way to control the direction of the twirl. This version can be found in turtle-race2.py and this version was what I was working toward and had envisioned when I set out to create this project. I was missing the second parameter in the function to call the name of the turtle so when I initially built it I was only turning the first turtle named "ada". Once this was pointed out it all worked out smoothly as intended!

### January 30, 2020
Moving forward with the [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) **Responsive Web Design Certificate**.

> Parts 20-30 out of 52 in the "Applied Visual Design" section taught me:
- how to move a relatively-positioned element,
- all about absolute and fixed positioning and how to affect those, and 
- more about complementary, secondary, and tertiary colors for use on screens.
>>>>>>> 5b5fd18745cdaaa7a29b2c9e05d2f2d55264d783

### January 29, 2020
I continued working on the [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) **Responsive Web Design Certificate**. 

> Parts 13-19 out of 52 in the "Applied Visual Design" section taught me:
- about text opacity and consistency (all uppercase, lowercase, capitalized, etc.),
- how to alter heading size, weight, line height, and 
- all about relative positioning.

### January 28, 2020
After working on some of the [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) trainings for another reason, I was recently reviewing all of the available info/trainings they have and noticed there were more HTML, CSS and JavaScript certifications. Therefore, I decided to continue working on these as I have already made some significant progress already. Picking up where I left off puts me in the middle of the **Responsive Web Design Certificate**.

> Parts 1-12 out of 52 in the "Applied Visual Design" section taught me:
- some basic tags for markup and text alignment within HTML directly, 
- how to adjust text and line sizes,
- and how to use text backgrounds and box shadows.

### January 24-26, 2020
These last few days I was reviewing and reorganizing/rewriting all of my notes on HTML, CSS and JavaScript that I have accumulated thus far in an effort to further all of my knowledge adn solidify what I have learned.

### January 23, 2020
Today I finished up the "Turtle Race!" project, including the final 2-3 challenges to try to figure out the code on your own. I was able to figure all of them out with some fiddling on my own except for 1: the "Dashed Lines" challenge. I knew it liekly needed to be a nested for loop, but wasn't entirely sure on the formatting and numbers so I did find an online resource to help me out with this. The final version of tyhe project should be available to view in my python-projects folder.

*Over the last few days I have also continued to review my CSS and JavaScript coding notes.*

> Raspberry Pi Intro to Python: [Turtle Race](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/turtle-race)

### January 22, 2020
Starting to learn more about the various programming languages available I am working on a vary basic project. One of the recommended introductory projects for Python was the "Turtle Race!" which I felt would be helpful to learn while also being lighthearted. Today I got to the "Racing Turtles" section of the tutorial.

### January 21, 2020
Today I completed the last few exercises, Lesson 13 - 15, from "Learn Python the Hard Way". At the end they have some reference material to continue working with Bash and/or the terminal. I played around with some of the commands to familiarize myself, including the info command, the exit command, removing a file and removing a directory, and streaming a file as well as paging up/down within said file.

> Learn Python the Hard Way - Starting at [Lesson 13](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/appendix-a-cli/ex13.html)

### January 15-16, 2020
I spent these two days reviewing my noes on JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

### January 14, 2020
My time today was spent reviewing some of my JavaScript notes and moving forward with the lessons from "Learn Python the Hard Way" getting through Exercises 9 - 12. In addition to practicing the other exercises as I continue through, I also spent time learning about making empty files with touch (or new-item for Windows), copying a file with cp, moving files around with mv, and viewing files with the less command.

> Learn Python the Hard Way - Starting at [Lesson 9](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/appendix-a-cli/ex9.html)

### January 13, 2020
The focus today was reading more in *Clean Code*. I read chapter 2 which explored much about naming recommendations and suggestions for cleaner code and overall best practices which appears to apply to most every computer language.

### January 12, 2020
Continuing from the lesson where I left off I completed lessons 5 - 8 from Learn Pythin the Hard Way. The most memorable lesson today was the information for additional ways to navigate through the directories using (cd ..) to go back 1 directory, (cd ../../..) to jump back 3+ directories, and the (pushd) and (popd) commands to save and jump to/through a list of saved directories.

> Learn Python the Hard Way - Starting at [Lesson 5](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/appendix-a-cli/ex5.html)

### January 10, 2020
To learn more about the terminal and the basics of Python, the site below was recommended. I spent time with lessons 1 - 4 in the free time I had today. Most memorable takeawy is that using the print working directoy (pwd) command will help you get your bearings and then the (cd ~) command will take you back to the home directory.

> [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/appendix-a-cli/introduction.html) - Starting with the advice to "SHUT UP AND TYPE ALL OF THIS IN." I dove into the first 4 lessons.

### January 9, 2020
I reworked and finalized my *Clean Code* Markdown file and moved it into a folder I created locally to see how the file system worked within GitHub. I read up on creating folders over the last few days and found out that an empty folder will not be stored/show up on GitHub. Additionally, I started chapter 2 of *Clean Code*.

### January 8, 2020
I wrote up a reflection on chapter 1 of *Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship* by Robert C. Martin in a new Markdown file.

### January 7, 2020
I created a new repository in GitHub using my new Raspberry Pi 4 (built last week). I used my terminal to download a Visual Studio Code remake made to support Raspian on a Linux platform. I spent time writing in my main README file which I will use as a sort of diary entry to briefly describe my daily activities.

> Followed the links [found here](https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-visual-studio-code/) - A big thank you to [@headmelted](https://github.com/headmelted) for building [a version of VSC](https://code.headmelted.com/) for alternative users!

Later I worked to set up a new folder (which I haven't done yet) for following the book I'm reading, *Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship* by Robert C. Martin. I wasn't entirely successful, but will continue this research to do it correctly.
